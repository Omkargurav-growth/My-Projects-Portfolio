## Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS) - Working Mechanism

### Key Features

- **Resume Parsing:** Natural Language Processing (NLP) extracts structured data
- **Keyword Matching:** Algorithms analyze resumes for job-relevant keywords
- **Candidate Ranking:** Automatic scoring based on qualification alignment
- **Application Management:** Centralized platform for tracking candidates
- **Reporting & Analytics:** Insights on time-to-hire, cost-per-hire, demographics

### ATS Optimization Strategies

1. Use relevant keywords from job description
2. Choose simple, clean formatting (avoid tables/images)
3. Use standard section headings (Summary, Experience, Education, Skills)
4. Submit in preferred format (.doc or .pdf)
5. Proofread carefully for errors

## Ethical & Managerial Considerations

### Critical Challenges

1. **Algorithmic Bias** - AI models trained on biased data perpetuate discrimination
2. **Data Privacy** - Sensitive employee data requires robust protection
3. **Lack of Transparency** - Black-box models erode trust and accountability
4. **Employee Concerns** - Workers fear replacement and loss of human judgment

### Mitigation Strategies

✅ **Diverse Datasets** - Include underrepresented groups in training data  
✅ **Bias Detection Tools** - Regularly audit AI models for fairness  
✅ **Explainable AI (XAI)** - Make decision-making transparent  
✅ **Human Oversight** - Maintain human judgment in final decisions  
✅ **Clear Policies** - Establish guidelines for AI use in HR  
✅ **Transparency & Consent** - Communicate openly with employees
