# Project Deliverables - Value Stream Mapping Project

## Main Deliverables

### 1. VSM-Presentation-On-Brush-Holder.pptx
**File Type:** PowerPoint Presentation
**Content:** Comprehensive presentation on Value Stream Mapping analysis for the Brush Holder manufacturing process.

**Presentation Includes:**
- **Title:** VALUE STREAM MAPPING VSM Information
- **Definition:** Value-stream mapping (also known as material- and information-flow mapping) is a lean-management method for analyzing the current state and designing a future state for the series of events that take a product or service from the beginning of the specific process until it reaches the customer.
- **Key Concepts:** Value stream maps display all critical steps in a specific process and easily quantify time and volume taken at each stage.

**Key Slides:**
1. VSM Overview and Purpose
   - Identify and remove waste in value streams
   - Increase efficiency in manufacturing
   - Create leaner operations

2. Types of Wastes Identified:
   - Faster-than-necessary Pace (Overproduction)
   - Waiting Time (Material delays)
   - Conveyance (Transport optimization)
   - Processing Complexity (Unnecessary procedures)
   - Excess Stock (Inventory management)
   - Unnecessary Motion (Ergonomic waste)
   - Correction of Mistakes (Quality defects)

3. Project Details:
   - **Customer:** Valeo India Pvt. Ltd, Pune
   - **Product:** Brush Holder
   - **Raw Material:** PPS GF 40 Grade (Ryton R4 200)
   - **OEM:** Suzuki
   - **Annual Volume:** 600,000 units/year
   - **Locations:** Pune (Primary), Mexico (Secondary)

4. Performance Metrics:
   - **Standard Takt Time:** 37.762 sec/part
   - **Actual Takt Time:** 37.951 sec/part
   - **Monthly Volumes (Pune):** 39,250-39,769 units
   - **Monthly Volumes (Mexico):** 10,066-10,800 units

5. Process Improvement Opportunities
   - Operator motion optimization
   - Gauge testing procedures
   - Change-over time reduction (Target: 15-30 min vs Current: 60 min)
   - Bin storage management (89 bins relocation)

### 2. VSM-DATA.xlsx
**File Type:** Excel Spreadsheet
**Content:** Supporting data and analytics for the VSM project analysis.

**Data Includes:**
- **NVAs (Non-Value Added Activities):** Identified waste activities in the process
- **NNVAs (Necessary Non-Value Added Activities):** Required but non-productive tasks
- **Scope of Improvement:** Specific areas for optimization

**Key Data Points:**
1. **Operator Motion for Material Movement**
   - Currently: Operator performs unnecessary motions
   - Improvement: Streamline material handling procedures

2. **Gauge Test and Verification**
   - Current: Part verification procedures need optimization
   - Target: Faster, more efficient quality checks

3. **Change-Over Time Management**
   - Current State: 60 minutes
   - Target State: 15-30 minutes
   - Potential Savings: 30-45 minutes per changeover

4. **Storage Optimization**
   - Current Issue: 89 bins stored at machine station
   - Risk: Safety incident potential
   - Solution: Relocation to DOC (Day-Old Concept) area
