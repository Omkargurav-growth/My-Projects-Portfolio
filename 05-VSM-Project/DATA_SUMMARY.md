## Efficiency Metrics

### Takt Time Analysis

**Standard Takt Time:** 37.762 seconds/part
- Calculated from firm schedule requirements
- Represents ideal production pace

**Actual Takt Time:** 37.951 seconds/part
- Based on dispatched quantities
- Variance: +0.189 seconds (+0.5%)

**Implications:**
- Current production is slightly slower than planned
- Minimal deviation indicates good process control
- Small efficiency gains possible through optimization

### Process Performance

| Metric | Target | Actual | Performance |
|--------|--------|--------|-------------|
| Takt Time (sec) | 37.762 | 37.951 | 99.5% |
| Schedule Adherence | 100% | 99% | Good |
| Quality (estimated) | - | High | Good |

## Opportunities for Improvement

### 1. Operator Motion Optimization
- **Current State:** Unnecessary movements in material handling
- **Target:** 15-20% reduction in motion waste
- **Expected Impact:** 5-7 seconds per cycle

### 2. Changeover Time Reduction
- **Current State:** 60 minutes per changeover
- **Target State:** 15-30 minutes
- **Potential Savings:** 30-45 minutes per changeover
- **Annual Impact:** 2-3 hours saved per changeover series

### 3. Quality & Verification Process
- **Current:** Manual gauge testing delays production
- **Improvement:** Automated/semi-automated verification
- **Expected Gain:** 3-5% capacity increase

### 4. Material Storage Optimization
- **Issue:** 89 bins stored at machine station
- **Risk:** Safety hazards, blocked access
- **Solution:** Relocate to Day-Old-Concept (DOC) area
- **Benefit:** Better floor space utilization, improved safety

## Non-Value Added Activities (NVAs)

1. **Operator unnecessary motion** - Material handling
2. **Testing delays** - Gauge verification bottleneck
3. **Excessive changeover time** - 60 minutes vs 15-30 target
4. **Storage congestion** - 89 bins at machine station
5. **Waiting time** - Material availability delays

## Value Stream Status

### Current Performance
- **Lead Time:** ~38 seconds per part in production
- **Quality:** Acceptable (meets OEM standards)
- **Schedule Adherence:** 99% (good)
- **Capacity Utilization:** 95-98% (high)

### Recommended Actions

**Priority 1 (High Impact):**
- Changeover time reduction program
- Material handling process redesign

**Priority 2 (Medium Impact):**
- Automated quality verification system
- Storage area reorganization

**Priority 3 (Ongoing):**
- Continuous improvement initiatives
- Staff training on lean principles

## Conclusion

The Brush Holder manufacturing process shows strong performance with 99% schedule adherence and minimal takt time variance. Implementing the identified improvements can potentially increase capacity by 5-7% and reduce production cycle time by 3-5 seconds per part, directly contributing to cost savings and customer satisfaction.
